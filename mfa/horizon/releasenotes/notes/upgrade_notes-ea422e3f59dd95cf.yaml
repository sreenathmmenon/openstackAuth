    Django 1.8 is now supported, and Django 1.7 is our minimum supported version.
upgrade:
  - Django 1.8 is now supported, and Django 1.7 is our minimum supported version.
    See `this <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/drop-django14-support>`__
    for more details.
  - Database-backed sessions will likely not persist across upgrades due to a
    change in their structure.
    See `this <https://github.com/openstack/django_openstack_auth/commit/8c64de92f4148d85704b10ea1f7bc441db2ddfee>`__
    for more details.
  - Horizon no longer uses QUnit in testing, and it has been removed from our
    requirements.
    See `this <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/replace-qunit-tests-with-jasmine>`__
    for more details.
  - Horizon now has multiple configuration options for the default web URL
    (``WEBROOT``), static file location (``STATIC_ROOT``) and static file URL
    (``STATIC_URL``) in its settings files.
  - Themes have moved location from ``openstack_dashboard/static/themes``, to
    ``openstack_dashboard/themes``. Paths may need to be updated accordingly.
    Furthermore, Horizon is aligning closer with Bootstrap markup, and themes
    should be built around this ideology; see the top bar and side navigation for
    details.
  - The deprecated ``OPENSTACK_QUANTUM_NETWORK`` configuration option has been
    removed. If you still use it, you need to replace it with
    ``OPENSTACK_NEUTRON_NETWORK``.
  - There is now an ``OPENSTACK_NOVA_EXTENSIONS_BLACKLIST`` option in the
    settings, to disable selected extensions for performance reasons.
    See `this <https://github.com/openstack/horizon/commit/18f4b752b8653c9389f8b0471eccaa0659707ebe>`__
    for more details.
  - Trove and Sahara panels now reside in ``openstack_dashboard/contrib``. This
    is to provide separation for reviews provided mostly by the service teams. In
    the future, these panels may become plugins rather than being kept in Horizon.
    See `this <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/plugin-sanity>`__
    for more details.
  - Horizon requires both a ``volume`` and ``volumev2`` endpoint for Cinder, even
    if only using v2.
  - Many JavaScript files and most notably the base page template
    (``horizon/templates/base.html``) have moved from the framework portion of
    the repo (``horizon``) to the application side (``openstack_dashboard``) to
    better separate the framework from the application.
